# SwanAPI

A fully functional restful API written in TS that has at least 1 object type and has endpoints for all the basic CRUD operators in REST. The api should accept the data in json and have instrumentation.

otherwise make me a pet store api
the classic
with animal types

parrot is a subtype of bird

make a Dog type with multiple distinct dog types like Poodle Pug and Labrador
I'd start by figuring out how types work and/or making an api endpoint that returns 200 OK

my first thought was to get all endpoints working then add the types in afterwards
you can do it this way for sure, I'd probably start with types personally
just to make sure you're not overthinking that either- the point I'm making here is that I (as the senior dev) don't really care about how you start your task, so I'd just advise if you're something doing too dumb to waste time on (you're not), say briefly what I might do, and let you do your thing
